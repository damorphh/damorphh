Hi, I’m @damorphh

I’m interested in 
- offensive security
- hacking
- Linux (I'm running MX Linux rn, though I used to be on OpenSuse)
- VR (rn I have a Quest 2, though I want to move to a Valve something at one point)
- OpSec/online privacy
I'm currently learning Python, and I'm still pretty much a beginner
I watch Mental Outlaw and The Linux Experiment on YouTube, PeerTube, and Odysee
